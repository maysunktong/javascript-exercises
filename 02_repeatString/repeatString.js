/*In the context of the repeatString function, you donâ€™t need to explicitly handle the case where num is 0 because the behavior of the loop will naturally result in an empty string.

Here's why:

When num is 0, the loop condition (i < num) evaluates to false immediately, so the loop body is never executed.
As a result, the result variable, which is initialized as an empty string (''), remains unchanged and is returned as an empty string.*/
